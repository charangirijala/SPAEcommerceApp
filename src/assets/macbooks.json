      "description": "The MacBook Air is a line of laptop computers developed and manufactured by Apple Inc. It consists of a full-size keyboard, a machined aluminum case, and, in the more modern versions, a thin light structure. The Air was originally positioned above the previous MacBook line as a premium ultraportable.[2] Since then, the original MacBooks discontinuation in 2011, and lowered prices on subsequent iterations, have made the Air Apples entry-level laptop.[3] In the current product line, the MacBook Air is situated below the performance range MacBook Pro."
